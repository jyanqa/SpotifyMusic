## Spotify Dataset Analysis

This is a project of Python Advanced MultiVariate Stats Lab.
<br/>
<br/>
The data contained in `data.csv.zip` represent various features from songs
extracted using **Spotify API**. Remember to **unzip** it before using. 
<br/>
Data Source is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=data.csv)"Download data directly from here")


## Usage
First thing to do, Open the file named **run.py** and click on **Run** button.
<br/>
Then you can apply four funtions on the console:
<br/>
- `LRMLE()` : used for implementing a linear regressor based on **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**
- `l1()`: used for computing the **L1 error** of the linear estimator and plot the predicted value
- `bootme()`: used for computing the **confidence interval** using **bootstrap resampling method**
- `clust()`: used for **clustering** the data according to the 'key' column and report
