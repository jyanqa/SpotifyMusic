## Spotify Dataset Analysis

This is a project of Python Advanced MultiVariate Stats Lab. 

<br/> The project aims to use Python Modular Structure and apply understanding of Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Boostrap resampling method, Regression and Clustering on analysing the dataset.
<br/>
<br/>
The data contained in `data.csv.zip` represents various features from songs
extracted using **Spotify API**, unzip before using it. [Source](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=data.csv " Download data directly from Kaggle " )


## Funtions <br/>

- Implementing a linear regressor based on **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**
- Computing the **L1 error** of the linear estimator and plot the predicted value
- Computing the **confidence interval** using **bootstrap resampling method**
- **clustering** the data according to the 'key' columns and report
